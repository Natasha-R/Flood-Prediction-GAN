## Generating Aerial Flood Prediction Imagery with Generative Adversarial Networks

This repo contains the code for training generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate aerial flood prediction imagery, when input an aerial pre-flooding image along with additional factors such as a digital elevation model, flow accumulation, distance to rivers, and map (OSM). 

This project is a current **work in progress**, hence the code and documentation is currently **incomplete.** Work status:  
- [x] Data pre-processing  
- [ ] Creating models ``🛠️ currently working on 🛠️``
- [ ] Training models  
- [ ] Evaluating results  
- [ ] Results presentation
